# üì∏ Stable Diffusion Helper üé®

Welcome to the Image Face Cropper project! This tool is designed to streamline the process of cropping faces from images, ensuring that you get the perfect crop every time. Whether you're working on a photo management application or simply need to process a batch of images for your next project, our tool is here to help.

## Features

- **Automatic Face Detection**: Utilizes `dlib`'s and `openCV`'s powerful face detection to identify faces in any image.
- **Smart Cropping**: Automatically crops images to focus on the detected faces, adjusting the size and aspect ratio as needed.
- **Image Standardization**: Converts and resizes images to a uniform format and size, making it easier to work with them in your projects.
- **Batch Processing**: Process an entire folder of images in one go, saving you time and effort.
- **Error Handling**: Keeps track of images that failed to process, allowing you to easily review and handle exceptions.
